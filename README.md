# Example: Using OOP with the DOM

### Objectives
1. Create a container in which to place several squares
2. Create a Square oop class that is in charge of defining the behavior of a square:
  * All squares have the same dimension
  * Each square has a different color
  * Squares spawn at a random coordinate on the screen
  * Clicking a square re-spawns the square in another random location and changes its color
3. Create a button that causes a new square object to be created from the Square class definition

### Keep Going
Adjust the code where we can create squares of different sizes
